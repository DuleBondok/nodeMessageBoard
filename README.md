# Node.js Message Board

Welcome to the **Node.js Message Board** project! This is a simple message board application built using **Node.js** and **Express**. It allows users to post messages with their names, and view all previously posted messages. The messages are stored in a file, making it easy to persist them across page reloads.

## Features

- Users can submit their name and message.
- Messages are displayed on the main page.
- New messages are added at the top of the message list.
- The data is saved in a JSON file (`messages.json`) to persist across page refreshes.

## How It Works

1. When you open the main page, you'll see a list of messages that have been posted.
2. Clicking the **"New Message"** button will open a form where you can enter your name and message.
3. Once you submit the form, the message gets added to the top of the message list, and is saved to a file (`messages.json`).
4. Refreshing the page will show the saved messages from the file.
